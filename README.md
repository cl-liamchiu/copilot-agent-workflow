# Copilot Agent Workflow Notes

A personal log of my experiments, workflows, and reflections using GitHub Copilot Agents.  
Inspired by [Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents (ACE)](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md#grounding-context-from-ai-engineer).

## 📌 Repository Structure
- **docs/**: Research notes and learnings  
- **workflows/**: Common workflow templates  
- **prompts/**: Collected prompts for different tasks  
- **examples/**: Real project use cases  

## 🎯 Goals
- Document how I design and refine Copilot agent workflows  
- Share practical tips, pitfalls, and best practices  
- Build a reference for myself and others who want to explore Copilot Agents  

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add more workflow templates  
- Test integration with larger production codebases  
- Experiment with multi-agent cooperation
