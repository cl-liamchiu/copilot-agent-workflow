# Experiment Log: [Title]
_Date: YYYY-MM-DD_

## 🎯 Goal
- What I want to achieve (e.g., fix a routing issue in Next.js, implement a new feature, compare two prompts/models).

## ⚙️ Setup
- Model: (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude, Copilot Agent)  
- Prompt(s) used:  
  - [paste or link to prompt file]  
- Repo / Feature context:  
  - [short description or link]  

## ⏱️ Time Tracking
- Start: HH:MM
- End: HH:MM
- Total: X hours / minutes

## 📝 Process
1. Step I tried (and what the agent responded)  
2. Adjustment I made (why I changed the prompt, or why I changed the approach)  
3. Observations (success? stuck? hallucinations? irrelevant code?)  

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- What didn’t work  
- Errors or wrong assumptions  
- How I solved them (or left unsolved)  

## ✅ Outcome
- Final solution / progress status  
- Code changes (if any)  
- Whether the goal was achieved  

## 💡 Reflections
- What worked well with this agent/prompt  
- What didn’t work  
- Next time I will try …
